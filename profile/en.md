## About the Event

The Game Development Meetup is a “place” created by all the participants together.

The theme is "**Weaving Fun in the Misty Fantasy Garden**."

Here, “Misty Fantasy” refers to something that is dispersed like mist, but where fun spreads infinitely. In this meetup, there is no one directing it; all participants understand the theme and concept, bring their creativity, and collaborate to operate **in a decentralized manner**.

Like a garden emerging in the mist, everyone's ideas overlap and naturally take shape. Each person enjoys creation at their own pace, from their own perspective, while inspiring and growing alongside others.

The word "weaving" implies people coming together and cooperating to create better works. Individual creativity can blossom freely and is further enriched through interactions with other participants. This is a space where we continue to explore the Misty Fantasy Garden together, sharing "fun" as we go.
